## Grading Categories

### 1. Technical Analysis and Calculations (~30 points)

This category assesses your ability to correctly apply chemical principles, perform calculations, and use appropriate methods.

#### Goal
- All calculations are correct with proper setup and methodology clearly shown
- Chemical principles (stoichiometry, thermodynamics, equilibrium, etc.) applied correctly
- Appropriate models and equations selected for the problem
- All assumptions stated and justified
- Spreadsheet formulas (when applicable) are correct and well-organized
- Minor errors only, if any

#### Avoid
- Fundamental calculation errors
- Major misunderstanding of chemical principles
- Inappropriate methods or no clear methodology
- Missing explicit requirements
- Analysis is not viable

**Key Focus Areas:**
- Show your work (formulas, setup, logic)
- Use correct units throughout
- Check reasonableness of results (does a 10,000°C temperature make sense?)
- State and justify any assumptions you make

---

### 2. Data Interpretation and Critical Thinking (~25 points)

This category evaluates your ability to analyze data, identify patterns, draw valid conclusions, and think critically about results.

#### Goal
- Data correctly interpreted with clear identification of key trends and patterns
- Results compared to appropriate standards, baselines, or theoretical predictions
- Quantitative statements throughout (specific values with units, not vague descriptions)
- Discrepancies or unexpected results identified and explained
- Alternative explanations considered where appropriate
- Demonstrates deep understanding of what the data reveals about the system


#### Avoid
- Major misinterpretation of data
- No meaningful comparison to standards
- Entirely qualitative with no quantitative support
- Results not analyzed for reasonableness
- No critical thinking evident
- Fundamental misunderstanding of data

**Key Focus Areas:**
- Always include specific values with units (not "contamination increased" but "Fe increased from 0.2 ppm to 12.5 ppm, a 62x increase")
- Compare your results to industry standards, theoretical predictions, or expected values
- Ask yourself: Do these results make physical/chemical sense?
- Identify trends across conditions (how does X change as Y increases?)
- Don't ignore outliers or unexpected results - explain them

### 3. Engineering Judgment and Recommendations (~20 points)

This category assesses your ability to make sound engineering decisions, consider practical constraints, and provide actionable recommendations.

#### Goal
- Recommendations are specific, actionable, and directly supported by data analysis
- Multiple valid approaches considered with clear tradeoff analysis
- Practical constraints (cost, time, feasibility, accuracy) explicitly addressed
- Priorities clearly identified and justified
- Decisions demonstrate sophisticated understanding of engineering context
- Verification/validation plan included for proposed solutions


#### Avoid
- No clear recommendations or recommendations contradict data
- No analysis of options
- No consideration of practical constraints
- No clear decision-making framework
- Recommendations not viable or inappropriate
- No thought given to implementation

**Key Focus Areas:**
- Be specific: "Inspect thermal furnace heating elements for corrosion" not "improve equipment"
- Acknowledge tradeoffs: "UV-Vis is faster and cheaper but ICP-MS provides definitive identification"
- Consider feasibility: Is your recommendation realistic given constraints?
- Justify your choices: Why is this the best approach?
- Think about verification: How would you confirm your solution worked?
- Recognize when multiple approaches are valid

### 4. Communication and Presentation (~15 points)

This category evaluates how effectively you communicate your analysis through writing and visualizations.

#### Goal
- Writing is clear, concise, and professional with minimal grammatical errors
- Document is well-organized with logical flow between sections
- Figures are clear, properly labeled (axes, units, legends), and professionally formatted
- Figure captions are descriptive and informative
- Tables are properly formatted with clear headers and consistent formatting
- All units clearly indicated and consistent throughout
- Technical terminology used correctly
- Document formatted according to assignment requirements 

#### Avoid
- Writing is very unclear or unprofessional
- No clear document organization
- Figures are unlabeled, unreadable, or missing
- No figure captions
- Any necessary Tables are absent or unusable
- Units missing throughout
- Technical terminology not understood
- Formatting requirements ignored
- Too verbose or pedagogical (this is not a lab report!)

**Key Focus Areas:**
- **Figures must have:**
  - Clear axis labels with units
  - Descriptive titles or captions
  - Legible text and symbols
  - Appropriate scale and formatting
  - Referenced in your text ("as shown in Figure 1...")

- **Units must be:**
  - Present on all numerical values
  - Consistent throughout the document
  - Appropriate for the quantity (ppm for concentrations, kJ/mol for energies, etc.)

- **Writing should be:**
  - Concise and direct (avoid unnecessary words)
  - Professional in tone (engineering memo, not casual email)
  - Free of major grammatical errors
  - Organized logically with clear section headers

---

### 5. Professionalism and Scholarship (~10 points)

This category assesses attention to detail, proper attribution, and overall professionalism.

#### Goal
- All sources properly cited in a consistent format
- Citations include textbook sections, online resources, and any AI tools used
- Document follows all submission requirements (file format, naming, zip structure)
- Work submitted on time
- No evidence of academic integrity violations
- Demonstrates careful attention to detail throughout

#### Avoid
- Failing to cite any sources you make use of
- Submission format completely wrong
- Very late or missing submission
- Academic integrity violations
- Work appears rushed or careless

**Key Focus Areas:**
- **Citations required for:**
  - Textbook chapters or sections used
  - Online resources consulted
  - Any AI assistance used (specify purpose: "AI used for proofreading and checking unit consistency")
  - Data sources or reference materials

- **Submission checklist:**
  - Correct file format (markdown with linked images in zip file)
  - Proper filename: ModuleX_LastName_FirstName.zip
  - All images included and properly linked
  - Submitted by deadline
  - All sections complete

- **Academic integrity:**
  - Show your own work and thinking
  - Cite all sources of assistance
  - If you consulted with classmates, acknowledge it
  - AI should enhance your learning, not replace your effort
